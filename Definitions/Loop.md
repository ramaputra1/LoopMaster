# Loop

One Fundamental concept in programming that allowed us to run a group of instruction or block of code repeatedly as long as the condition is meet.

Other than that, Loop can help us to:

1. Process datas in array, list, set or other group.
   In general, sometimes we use it to _read_ the element one by one and do operation with that like _Searching_.
2. Validate the input from user. For example, _we can ask input from user repeatdly until the inpur is correct_.
3. Navigate through a complex data such as list, dictionary or array multidimension. Ussualy, for _searching_.
4. We also use loop for some algorithm. E.g: Buble, Binary search for Sorting.
5. Control program in condition. Use _break_ and _continue_ to control the program.
6. Copying recursion behavior.
7. Manage _Timer_ or _Counter_
